A passerby? A hacker? Perhaps a vampire! Let's say I'm an 18-year-old nerd from a country called Egypt who does bug hunting stuff....

### More Information

Well, on the cyberspace, I go by "*0xSobky*". I'm a str('Pythonista') who thinks in "${Perl}" and talks in /JavaScript/! A Django-er to the core, but also a Flask-er! I do Bash and Powershell too. Also a '*Sūpā Hakā*', whatever that means! ...sounds interesting? You may take a look at my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/0xsobky/)!
