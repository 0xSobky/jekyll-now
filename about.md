A passerby? A hacker? Perhaps a vampire! Let's say I'm an 18-year-old nerd from a country called Egypt who does bug hunting stuff....

### More Information

Well, on the cyberspace, I go by "*0xSobky*". I'm a `str('Pythonista')` who thinks in `"${Perl}"` and talks in `/JavaScript/`! A Django-er to the core, but also a Flask-er! I do Bash and Powershell too. Also a '*Sūpā Hakā*', whatever that means! ...sounds interesting? You may take a look at my <a href="javascript:alert(`([].map+'')[9]+(1/0+'')[7]+(top+'')[7]+(typeof!1)[0]+(typeof!1)[3]+({}+[])[1]+(typeof '')[5]+(top+'')[7]+(typeof '')[3]+(typeof '')[0]+(top+'')[7]+(0/{}+'')[1]+(top+'')[7]+(!0+'')[1]+(!1+'')[4]+(!1+'')[3]+(!0+'')[2]+([].map+'')[9]+(!1+'')[4]`)">résumé</a>!
